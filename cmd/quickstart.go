	Use:   "quickstart <endpoint>",
	Short: "Get started with zero configuration and protect a local API or web service",
	Long: `This command follows the quickstart guide on the Ory cloud platform. Assuming that you are running
some type of HTTP(s) web service locally (e.g. NodeJS, Java, PHP,) - be it an API or something that serves HTML, images,
or some other type of data over HTTP, this command will add authentication and authorization to that service without
any additional work.

Given a web service that is running on http://localhost:1234, you would run the quickstart command as follows:

$ ory quickstart -k <your-api-key> http://localhost:1234

All requests to http://localhost:1234/ now require authentication and authorization when accessed via:

	http://localhost:3313

Requests to http://localhost:3313/ will be forwarded to your service (http://localhost:1234/) when authorized:

* Accessing http://localhost:3313/foo/bar will proxy the request to http://localhost:1234/foo/bar when a valid user
  session exists.
* Accessing http://localhost:3313/foo/bar directly in the browser will redirect the browser to the login screen
  when no valid user session exists.
* Accessing http://localhost:3313/foo/bar via an API request (e.g. AJAX) will respond with 401 Unauthorized and a JSON
  containing information how to continue.`,
